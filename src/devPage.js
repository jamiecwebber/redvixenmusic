						<h1>Asyla: Solutions for Refugees and Refugee Resettlement Agencies</h1>
						<p>A common experience of refugees arriving in Canada is a lack of coherence in the services offered by resettlement agencies, and these agencies often struggle to keep up with the many facets of receiving a newcomer into our society. Asyla was built to respond to this need. Through a mobile application, the refugee can track their progress on a number of goals, consult a calendar of upcoming appointments, have access to reference images of important documents, and directly contact their resettlement agent if a problem arises. An employee of the resettlement agency can access a full-screen view where she can manage several clients, respond to their queries and see the important tasks in a single unified view.</p>
						<p>My contributions to the project included programming the interactive calendar and task manager, developing the back-end code for accessing filtered lists of tasks, and displaying these with drop-down information panels in the client-side application.</p>

						<h1>Freelance Google Chrome Extension</h1>
						<p>I can't say too much, but I was commissioned to make a Chrome extension that scrapes webpages for specific links and processed their text content with the Google Cloud AutoML API. Seeing as this API is still a beta product and Chrome Extensions are not very powerful, communicating between the two proved difficult. I found that I needed to make a serverless web relay function to pass information between the extension and the Machine Learning algorithm.</p>
